Customers appreciate a wide-ranging selection. This section will help you learn how to add your products to Fastweed’s catalog, manage your inventory, and create high quality listings. These sections cover the following topics:

* Listing products

* Creating product variations

#### Listing products

There are multiple ways to add new products to the Fastweed catalog:

* Use the Add Product feature
* Match to an existing listing using the Add Product feature
* Upload multiple products at a time using the Bulk Upload feature

##### Use the Add Product feature

The Add Product tool is a simple interface that lets you create listings one-by-one, and can be used for the following:

* Create a brand new product in Fastweed’s catalog
* List a small number of products
* Use a simple interface rather than a spreadsheet to upload products

##### Match to an existing listing using Assign Product

If you’re selling products that are already in Fastweed’s catalog, you can easily create listings by matching to the existing product by using the Add Product tool.

##### Upload multiple products using the Bulk Upload feature

Vendors can use the Mass Upload Product tool to upload products in bulk rather than uploading products one-by-one.

## Manage Inventory

There are multiple ways to manage inventory:

* ###### Using the Add Product tool
  * Set your stock and stock availability status
  * Set your stock for each store location, if applicable
* ###### Using the Products Per Store tool
  * Manage your stock for each store location across multiple products
* ###### Using the Mass Upload Product tool
  * Set your stock and stock availability for each product using a spreadsheet

## Set Store Locations

Some vendors have physical store locations where customers can come pickup their orders. Fastweed’s Store Pickup service allows vendors to advertise one or more of their store locations while manage separating inventory at each location.

Store Pickup is one of the main shipping methods vendors offer to their customers due to the limitations around shipping cannabis-related products. Customers are able to find your products because Fastweed filters products by distance based on the customer’s My Location setting that is set when customers first enter the site.

## Set Local Delivery Areas

Many vendors offer delivery services where drivers will deliver products directly to their customers. Fastweed’s Local Delivery service gives you the ability to define one or more Delivery Areas simply by setting a location and a radius. Vendors also have the ability to define Delivery Rates based on distance. This way, any customers within your delivery area searching for the Local Delivery shipping method will be able to view your products.

In order to provide a more convenient delivery service to your customers, vendors can enable the Time Slots Configuration service to offer available time slots based on the number of drivers available at any given time. For instance, if you have 2 drivers available who are able to complete 10 deliveries between the hours of 6:00 pm and 7:00 pm, only the first 10 customers are able to select this delivery time slot.

Vendors can define both Store Pickup and Local Delivery shipping methods if they offer both services.

## Manage Employee Access

Account owners are able to create additional User Accounts to provide limited access to the services in their Vendor console. If you would like your employees to have access to process orders but not to modify your products, you can easily control who sees what.

## Schedule Discounts with Daily Deals

Vendor can use the Daily Deals service to discount products on a predefined schedule. You can easily discount your products by a fixed price or by a percent of the price. Scheduled pricing will start and stop on days and times that you decide, giving you full control of your discounts.

## Generate Coupons

The Seller Coupons service makes it easier for vendors to create and distribute coupons to customers. It also makes it seamless for your customers to redeem those coupons when purchasing your products.

Vendors are able to generate digital coupons that customers can redeem during checkout for product discounts. Vendors can create multiple coupons at a time for any sales promotion, for marketing campaign offers, or for customer loyalty. Set an expiration date to ensure coupons are valid only for a limited time or during a specific season.

Appeal to the price conscious consumers by giving them ways to save.

## Give Loyalty Points to Returning Customers

## Take Preorders

Sold out but have more coming, drying, or curing? Vendors can enable the Preorder option on their products and specify a date when they will be available. So even though you are currently out of stock on certain items, you can let your customers know what’s coming in and when. You can even take complete or partial payment if you would like customers to be able to reserve their items for pickup or delivery when they become available.

## Communicate to Followers

Customers are able to contact vendors on any product page or from your seller profile page. They simply fill out a form to send you an email. Customers are also able to add your shop as one of their favorites. When they do, they will display as one of your Shop Followers. You can send emails to all of your Shop Followers to keep them informed of your latest updates.

## Advertise on the Homepage

Vendors are able to Advertise on the Homepage in local regions if they wish. This is the only paid service that Fastweed offers. Vendors can create Advertising Images that advertise their products, services, or collective. You choose a location and radius where your Advertising Images will display. When purchasing Advertising Positions, you can choose the top or the bottom of the homepage and how long you would like your advertisement to be valid. The price of the ad depends on the radius distance and the number of days you would like your ad to display.
