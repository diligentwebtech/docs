## What is Fastweed Store Pickup?

Fastweed Store Pickup provides vendors with services to add physical store locations, manage products and inventory at those store locations, and to process orders where customers are coming into the store to settle the transaction. Fastweed Store Pickup allows you to display your products on the storefront so that your customers can send you an order that is going to be picked up from your store location. You can define multiple store locations and you can create relationships between your products and your stores to manage separate inventory at each location.

## Features of Fastweed Store Pickup

Fastweed Store Pickup provides the following features:

* Advertise your products within a 50 mile radius so that customers can place orders to be picked up at your physical store locations
* Add, edit, and delete multiple store locations
* Promote your store hours and contact information
* Assign and remove relationships between your products and stores
* Manage the item-level inventory for all the products available in your stores
* Quickly enable and disable visibility of products to customers without losing product/store relationships

## Getting Started

If you've already signed up as a Fastweed Vendor and have added one or more products, you can start using the Fastweed Store Pickup service immediately. You can open the Fastweed Vendor console, choose Add Store, and follow the steps to create your first store location then proceed to Step 4: Assign Products to your Store and Manage Store Inventory.

If you haven't signed up as a Fastweed Vendor yet, or if you need assistance creating your first store location, complete the following tasks to get set up to use the Fastweed Store Pickup service:

* Step 1: Sign Up as a Fastweed Vendor
* Step 2: Create a Product
* Step 3: Create a Store
* Step 4: Assign a Product to your Store and Manage Store Inventory
* Step 5: Place a Store Pickup Test Order

#### Step 1: Sign up as a Fastweed Vendor

When you sign up as a Fastweed Vendor, your Fastweed Vendor account is automatically signed up for all vendor services on Fastweed, including Fastweed Store Pickup. You are not charged for any service except for optional sponsored services if you choose to send us a check.

With Fastweed Store Pickup, it is completely free.

If you have a Fastweed Vendor account already, skip to the next task. If you don't have a Fastweed Vendor account, use the following procedure to create one.

##### To create an Fastweed account

Open https://www.fastweed.com/, and then choose Sign In > Register in the upper right corner.
Be sure to click the “Click here to register as a vendor” link
Follow the online instructions

#### Step 2: Create a Product

Before you can add a product to a store, you must first create a product. There are multiple ways to add new products to the Fastweed catalog:

* Use the Add Product feature
* Match to an existing listing using the Add Product feature
* Upload multiple products at a time using the Mass Upload Product feature

For the purpose of this guide, we will be creating a new test product using the Add Product tool.

##### To create a new product

1. In the navigation pane of the Vendor console, choose Add Product
2. For Attribute Set, choose Consumable
* Note
  * For information about Attribute Sets, see Using the Add Product tool
3. For Product Type, choose Simple
* Note
  * For information about the difference in using Simple or Configurable, see the Using the Add Product tool
4. Click the Continue button in the upper right corner of the page
5. For Product Category, select the checkbox next to the Preroll Category to classify your product
6. Next, fill out all the necessary information to complete your product listing
* Required fields: Product Name, Description, SKU, Price, Stock, Stock Availability, Visibility, Tax Class, and License Type
  * Note
    * The SKU must be unique and cannot match any other SKU in Fastweed’s catalog. If you have a matching SKU, it is probably better to match to an existing listing using the Add Product tool
7. Click the Save button to create your new product

For more information on creating new products, see Using the Add Product tool.

Your product is not yet visible on the site. You still need to add Store Pickup as an available shipping method before your product will display to customers. Now that you have created a product, let’s create a store so we can add the product to the store.

#### Step 3: Create a Store

Stores are physical store locations where customers can come, pickup, and pay for their transaction onsite. You must add a store and assign products to your store in order for your products to be visible in the Fastweed catalog.

##### To create a store

1. In the navigation pane of the Vendor console, choose Add Store
2. Next, fill out all the necessary information to add your store location
* Required fields: Store Name, Store Contact Number, Store Image, Status, Street Address, Latitude, Longitude, City, State/Province, Zip/Postal Code, and Country
  * Note
    * When selecting your Street Address, the other location fields should auto-populate after selecting your location from the Street Address auto-complete option.
3. For Store Hours, select your opening and closing hours for each day of the week
* Note
  * Currently, the Store Hours option does not allow users to set a closing time before a start time. For example, the system will not allow a Vendor define Store Hours from 11:00 am to 2:00 am because 2:00 am is before 11:00 am, not after. We are working on a solution to fix this issue so Vendors can properly set their Store Hour details. Thank you for your patience.
4. Click Save Store

You have now created a store and can use the same process to create more stores. Now all we need to do is create a relationship between your product and your store.

##### To edit a store or store hours

1. In the navigation pane of the Vendor console, choose View All Stores
2. Click the edit icon under the Action column
3. Select OK to confirm that you would like to edit your store
4. Modify your store details or store hours
5. Click the Save Store button

##### To delete a store

1. In the navigation pane of the Vendor console, choose View All Stores
2. There are two ways to delete a store:
3. Click the trash can icon under the Action column
4. Select the checkbox and select Delete in the Action dropdown, then click the Submit button

Be careful! Removing your store will also permanently remove all your product/store relationships.

#### Step 4: Assign a Product to your Store and Manage Store Inventory

After you have created your product and your store, you can manage your product/store relationships and inventory using the Products Per Store tool. This tool allows vendors to add, edit, delete, as well as enable and disable product/store relationships. You can also manage store inventory for each product across all your stores.

##### To assign a product to your store and to manage store inventory

1. In the navigation pane of the Vendor console, choose Products Per Store
2. Find the product you would like to assign to your store by using the Product Name field at the top of the page or by browsing the result set showing all your available products
3. In the Store column, you will see the Not Assigned value in the dropdown. This means that your products are not related to your store by default
4. There are multiple ways to create product/store relationships and to manage your stores’ inventory on this page:
* Each product, one-by-one
  * Select the checkbox associated with one or more products you wish to edit
  * In the Store column, find and select your store name in the dropdown
  * In the Qty Assigned to Store column, enter the quantity available at your store location
  * If you have more than one store available, you may click the Add (+) Action on the right and another dropdown option will display in the Store option as well as another Qty Assigned to Store field. This allows you to manage store inventory across all your available stores.
  * Click the Save Products button
* All selected products
  * Select the checkbox associated with one or more products you wish to edit
  * Click the Assign Stores button
  * Notice the number of products selected will be related to whatever store you select in the dropdown
  * If you have existing stock quantities on the product record(s) in the Stock field using the Add Product tool, you can choose the first option and set the quantities at your store to inherit the value in the Stock field
  * If you would like to overwrite the existing stock quantities on the product record(s) with a specific value, choose the second option and enter a value for quantity.
  * Click the Assign button
* All products in your seller catalog
  * Click the Assign All Product button
  * Notice all of your products will be related to whatever store you select in the dropdown
  * If you have existing stock quantities on the product record(s) in the Stock field using the Add Product tool, you can choose the first option and set the quantities at your store to inherit the value in the Stock field
  * If you would like to overwrite the existing stock quantities on the product record(s) with a specific value, choose the second option and enter a value for quantity.
  * Click the Assign button
* Note
  * Modifications to a product’s quantity value will affect the quantity value in the Stock field on the Add Product page

##### Enable or disable visibility of products at your store

If you would like to temporarily disable the visibility of one or more products that are related to your store without affecting the product/store relationship or the quantity available, follow these steps:

1. Select the checkbox associated with one or more products you wish to edit
2. Click the Action dropdown option and select Disable
3. Notice the Status column will say Disable next to your product

Conversely, follow the same steps but select Enable to add your products back to the category and search pages.

After saving your changes on the Products Per Store page, your listing may take up to 30 minutes to reflect your changes to customers on the storefront.

#### Step 5: Place a Store Pickup Test Order

To ensure customers are able to send you orders online, and everything works as expected, you should place a test order for your product and select the Store Pickup shipping method on checkout. Be sure to test the entire order workflow where you receive an order confirmation number. Then you can simply cancel the order.

##### To place a Store Pickup test order

1. In the navigation pane of the Vendor console, choose Products Per Store
2. Find the product you would like to test by using the Product Name field at the top of the page or by browsing the result set showing all your available products
3. Be sure there is quantity available for your test order and a store location has been saved
4. In the Product column, click the link on the product’s name to open the product page in a new tab
* Note
  * If you see a message at the top of the page saying “This product is not available at your location. Browse products at your location in the Indica category.” or some other category, it means that your “My Location” setting at the top of the page is outside the 50 mile radius of the store location. The same store location which the product is related to is on the Products Per Store page.
  * To fix this issue, change your “My Location” setting to a location that is within a 50 mile radius of your store location.
5. Go to the new tab and select the Add to Cart button next to your product on the product page. Be sure to select any configurable options if any are required.
* Note
  * Results on the product page are first sorted by the Store Finder tool if a store is selected. If not, the results on the product page are sorted by distance from your “My Location” setting at the top of the page.
  * If you’re product has multiple vendors, and there is another store between your “My Location” setting and your store’s location, your product offer may appear in the result set below the Buy Box. Be sure you are placing a test order for the correct product.
6. Click the Cart button on the top right corner of the page to view your shopping cart
7. Select the Proceed to Checkout” button
8. Fill out the required customer information if you are not logged in
9. Under Shipping Methods, select the Store Pickup At checkbox
10. Click the Next button
11. For Payment Method on the next page, select the Cash on Delivery
12. Click the Place Order button
13. On the next page, you will receive an order confirmation number
14. Congratulations! You have successfully placed a test order
15. To view your test order, login to your Vendor account and choose Vendor Order History in the navigation pane
16. Notice your test order in Pending status
* Note
  * The Vendor Order History interface is different from the My Orders interface under the My Account section
  * If you click on the order confirmation number on the Thank You page, you will be directed to the My Orders interface under the My Account section.
  * If you created the product in your Vendor account (1) but you used a different account (2) when placing the order, be sure to login to the Vendor account (1) to view the order.
17. Click the View Order button
